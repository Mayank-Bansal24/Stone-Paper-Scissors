# Stone-Paper-Scissors
ML game based on Hand Recognition

Developed an ML-based system that recognizes hand gestures and then runs a game of hand paper scissors with the computer.

You can record your own hand gestures firstly and then run the game.

The model is trained and further the model classifies hand gestures accordingly.

The Laptop will randomly choose any gesture for itself and compare both according to given commands.

The score is then displayed on a LCD screen which is coded using Raspberry Pi.
